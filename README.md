# YuktaBhange_Thesis
The repository contains code files, data files and result code of the dissertations project.



## Project Overview

This repository contains various models and statistical tests implemented in R and Python.

### Contents

- **R Code**: 
  - **SBM Model**: Implements the Stochastic Block Model (SBM).
  - **MI Model**: Contains code for the Mutual Information (MI) model.

- **Python Code**:
  - **CBR-GA Model**: Includes the implementation of the Case-Based Reasoning Genetic Algorithm (CBR-GA).
  - **Model Results**: Python scripts for running and analyzing results of various models.
  - **Statistical Tests**: Scripts for performing statistical tests on model outputs.

### Data

- The `data` folder contains all necessary datasets for running the models.
  - Some data files are provided in zipped format.
  - Ensure the correct paths are set within the code files if you plan to execute the scripts.

### Usage

- Before running any scripts, ensure that the paths to the data files are correctly configured. You can adjust the file paths within the scripts as needed.
